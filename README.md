<h1>About</h1>
<p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game often played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has simple rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. This seemingly simple game is often used as a decision-making tool, a playful contest, or a means to resolve disputes. Despite its simplicity, Rock-Paper-Scissors can involve psychological strategy, as players might try to predict and counter their opponent's next move based on previous patterns. The game is widely recognized across cultures and is known for its quick pace and easy-to-understand mechanics, making it a popular choice for both casual play and competitive events.</p>
